# Representations

The representations are the style of molecule in molstar viewer, e.g. cartoon, ball-and-stick. Representations should be assigned to a certain component. A component can have multiple representations. 

In *dash-molstar*, users can import the class `Representation` to control all the settings in their representations:

```py
from dash_molstar.utils.representations import Representation
rep = Representation()
```

A representation has settings in three catogories: [type](#type), [color](#color) and [size](#size). Only the `type` is mandatory, and if other properties were not specified, they will stay as molstar default. By default, the above code will give you an instance with **cartoon** representation. 

## Customize the representation

You can specify the representation type on instance creation or change it later:

```py
from dash_molstar.utils.representations import Representation

rep = Representation()      # default cartoon representation
rep.type = 'ball-and-stick' # change rep to ball-and-stick

# or specify its type in constructor
surface = Representation('gaussian-surface')
```

You can also change the `color` and `size` for the instance:

```py
from dash_molstar.utils.representations import Representation

rep = Representation(type='gaussian-surface', color='hydrophobicity')

# set them later is also fine
rep.color = 'residue-name'
```

The default color scheme in molstar is by **chain-id**, whereas the default size scheme vary with representation type. `color` and `size` can also be set to `None` if you want to disgard all the changes on them in your instance. This way they will fall back to molstar default. 

Each type, color and size comes with a lot of parameters. They can be set by the class function `set_type_params()`, `set_color_params()` and `set_size_params()`, respectively.

For example, if you wish to create a look that the surface is wrapping the backbone, you can write your code as follows:

```py
import dash_molstar
from dash import Dash, html
from dash_molstar.utils import molstar_helper
from dash_molstar.utils.representations import Representation

# select some residues
chain_A = molstar_helper.get_targets(chain='A', residue=list(range(42,77)))

# create and configure representations
cartoon = Representation(type='cartoon', color='secondary-structure')
surface = Representation(type='gaussian-surface', color='uniform')
surface.set_type_params({'alpha': 0.1, 'radiusOffset': 0.3})
surface.set_color_params({'value': 0x009CE0})

# create a component with the given representation on the target
component = molstar_helper.create_component(label='Protein', targets=chain_A, 
                                            representation=[cartoon, surface])

# load a cif file and disable the default representation
data = molstar_helper.parse_url("https://files.rcsb.org/download/1UJS.cif", 
                                component=component, preset={'kind':'empty'})

enableOutline = {'postprocessing': {'outline': Representation.np('on', {'scale': 1,'threshold': 0.33,'color': 0x000000,'includeTransparent': True})}}
app = Dash(__name__)
app.layout = html.Div(
    dash_molstar.MolstarViewer(
        id='viewer', style={'width': '500px', 'height':'500px'},
        data=data, layout={'canvas3d': enableOutline}
    ),
)

if __name__ == '__main__':
   app.run_server(debug=True)
```

:::{note}
:name: NamedParams

About **NamedParams**

NamedParams is a data type defined by Molstar, which is designed to manage parameters with multiple child options. 
NamedParams can be generated by the helper function `Representation.np(name, params)`. This function is a static 
method, which means you can call it without an instance of the *Representation* class.

A NamedParams object has two parts: *name* and *params*. `name` is a string, while `params` is a dictionary 
with options and values. For example, the [gaussian-surface](#gaussian-surface) representation has an option 
*smoothColors*, whose value is NamedParams. `on`, `off` and `auto` are names of the NamedParams. `auto` and `off` 
have no params, corresponding to `None`, but `on` has two options. Then we can set the parameters as follows:

```py
surface = Representation(type='gaussian-surface')

# set smoothColors to off, params as None by default
surface.set_type_params({'smoothColors': surface.np('off')})

# set smoothColors to on, with child option values
surface.set_type_params({
    'smoothColors': surface.np('on', {
        'resolutionFactor': 2, 
        'sampleStride': 3
    })
})
```
:::

## Save and load configurations

Representation can be easily saved to and loaded from *JSON* files. The Representation class member function 
`save_config()` is used to save the *JSON* file, and `from_config()` can load the configurations in a *JSON*.

```py
surface = Representation(type='gaussian-surface', color='uniform')
surface.set_type_params({'alpha': 0.1, 'radiusOffset': 0.3})
surface.set_color_params({'value': 0x009CE0})

# save to JSON
surface.save_config('surface.json')

# load the saved JSON
new_surface = Representation.from_config('surface.json')
```

## Representation parameters
All the available settings for representations are listed below.

### Type
The `type` parameter controls the shape of the representation shown in the viewer. Currently, the following representation types can be specified by dash-molstar: *[label](#label)*, *[cartoon](#cartoon)*, *[backbone](#backbone)*, *[ball-and-stick](#ball-and-stick)*, *[carbohydrate](#carbohydrate)*, *[ellipsoid](#ellipsoid)*, *[gaussian-surface](#gaussian-surface)*, *[gaussian-volume](#gaussian-volume)*, *[line](#line)*, *[molecular-surface](#molecular-surface)*, *[orientation](#orientation)*, *[point](#point)*, *[putty](#putty)*, *[spacefill](#spacefill)*.
